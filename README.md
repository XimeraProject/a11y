Code for accessibility


* \answer needs default alt-text of "unanswered" that is replaced with "answered VALUE Correct/Incorrect" after answering. 
* \answer needs optional argument alt={my groovy text} which modifies the default by "'my groovy text' unanswered" or "'my groovy text' answered VALUE"
* Math mode could default to mathml if no alt-text is given
* The text given by accessibility could be the underlying text in the browser DVI
