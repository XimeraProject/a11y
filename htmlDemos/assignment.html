  <h2> Finance </h2>

  Here we do a finance question.

  <h3> A problem  </h3>

  <h4> Question</h4>
  When you take out a loan, the amount of the loan is called
  <b>principal</b>.  For most loans, interest is calculated monthly,
  based on an <b>annual interest rate</b>, and based on the remaining
  balance.  When you make a payment, your payment first offsets the
  accumulated interest and then is applied to principal, in order to
  calculate the <b>remaining principal balance</b>.  The loan is paid
  back in full when the remaining principal balance is reduced to zero.
  
  Suppose you borrow $5,000 and agree to pay it back in equal
  annual payments over 5 years.  Interest is calculated at 7%,
  compounded annually.  We will approach this problem numerically.
  Use your guess for the annual payment, and complete the table
  below. Round all answers to the nearest cent.



  A loan pay-off table showing the 0th year in the first row, followed
  by the first year in the second row, followed by the second year in
  the third row, the third year in the fourth row, and the fifth year
  in the sixth row.  The first column is the year, the second column
  is the interest, the third column is the balance with interest, the
  fourth column is the payment, the fifth column is the remaining
  principal balance.

<h2>A worked example</h2>


<h4> Example </h4>
Sketch the graph of the function defined by f(x)=2x^3-3x^2-12x.

The y-intercept is (0,unanswered<input></input> ). Place this point on your plot.

We show the (x,y) plane with a point plotted at the origin.

Which of the following are vertical asymptotes?  Select all that apply.

<form action="??">
  <input type="checkbox" id="idx" name="namex" value="valx">
  <label for="forx">x=0</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="idx" name="namex" value="valx">
  <label for="forx">x=1</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="idx" name="namex" value="valx">
  <label for="forx">x=-1</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="idx" name="namex" value="valx">
  <label for="forx">x equals the square root of 2</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="idx" name="namex" value="valx">
  <label for="forx">There are no vertical asymptotes</label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>


In this case,

f(x) =2x^3-3x^2-12x

, we can find the

x

-intercepts.   There are three

x

intercepts.  Call them

a

,

b

, and

c

, and order them such that

a<b<c

.  Then

a = unanswered<input></input>
b = unanswered<input></input>
c = unanswered<input></input>

     Which of the following best describes the end behavior of

     f as

     x goes to infinity

     ?
